If you feel stuck, solutions to this exercise are available [here](solution).

1. Modify Example02 to model the SC2 phase shown in FIG 1. Verify that the spin wave frequencies match eqn. 24.

  note: the angle \alpha is given by eqn. 18. 

2. Recreate the upper portion of Fig. 7.

  note: Comparing intensities with the paper requires is possible but requires either
  
    1. calculating the inelastic neutron-scattering cross section from the spin-spin correlation function.
      eqn A9 of [PHYSICAL REVIEW B 87, 134416 (2013)](http://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.87.134416)
   
    2. [modifying SpinWaveGenie](https://github.com/SpinWaveGenie/SpinWaveGenie/blob/master/libSpinWaveGenie/src/Genie/SpinWave.cpp#L290) to examine intermediate output.
