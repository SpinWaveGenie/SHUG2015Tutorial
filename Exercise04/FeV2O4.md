If you feel stuck, solutions to this exercise are available here.

1. Modify Exercise04 to calculate the spin wave dispersion of FeV2O4 published in [Phys. Rev. B. 89 224404](http://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.89.224404).

2. Try recreating FIG 2 a-d and FIG 3a. 

(extra) try calculating two-dimensional cuts along these directions.
